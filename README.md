Hi! I'm Hexter,
I'm interested in programming but I'm still a beginner and looking forward to learn new stuff about programming.
I'm still in junior college and learn programming as a hobby. I know some basic Python and I have also made some 
beginner projects, and I joined git hub to learn how I can improve myself.
